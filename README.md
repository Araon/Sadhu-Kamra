Ever thought about what will it be like if a Sadhu becomes a Comedian !!??


There was plenty of talk at the end of the interview that the reason the Sadhu would get a second career is to be as funny as he can, not the type who would become one of the most popular Comedians around! Or possibly if he would only go through college it means he would be as cool as ever and we are just about to hear more about that.
